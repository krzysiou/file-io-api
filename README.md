# file-io-api


This is a ```Node.js RestAPI``` developed for my [file-io](https://github.com/krzysiou/file-io) website. It contains endpoints which allow front-end to send and request data. It got hot-reload feature using nodemon. To host server on your computer simply type ```nvm use ``` and ```npm install``` then provide your working directory with ```.env file``` containing key ```ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET``` and give it a custom value of your choice. Enter ```npm run dev``` in command line and you are ready to go.
